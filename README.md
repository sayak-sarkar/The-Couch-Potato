The Couch Potato
================

The Couch Potato CMS is a content Management system application created as project work for the Content Management System course during my days of MSc(CA) at SICSR. It is a mini content management system for creating websites pertaining to maintaining information about various movie titles. 

It is a Web Content Management System, where a user can create his/her own site showcasing his/her personal movie database. The CMS allows creation of custom pages, addition of new content like movie details, cast, year, poster, etc. The look and feel of the website are customizable, and currently provides “Administrator” and “User” as the roles available for operation.

Language:  Front end: PHP; Back End: MySQL

Project Duration:  7 days. 

It is a web-application that allows users to easily publish documents and articles online, without the need for much technical knowledge. It is an attempt to create a working prototype of a content management system with some basic features.

Fun Fact
========

The idea for developing the CMS came into my mind from the header image of the CMS itself. I drew the image using MS-Paint during one really boring SPM lecture one afternoon post-lunch to keep myself awake. ;-)
